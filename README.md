## FAQs ‚ùì
### Q: Where do I get the Hugging Face API key?
A: Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), go to [Settings > Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), and create a token with **Inference API** access.

### Q: Why is the recipe taking so long to generate?
A: The free-tier Hugging Face Inference API has limited speed. For faster results, consider upgrading your API plan.

### Q: Is there a limit on the number of requests I can make with the free-tire Hugging Face API?
A: Yes, the free-tire Hugging Face API allows up to **20 requests per month**. Once the limit is reached, you may need to wait for the next month or consider upgrading to a paid plan.

### Q: Can I add dietary restrictions?
A: Not yet! This is a planned feature. Feel free to contribute!
